Force.com Toolkit for PHP
=========================

This is forked from [!developerforce/Force.com-Toolkit-for-PHP](https://github.com/developerforce/Force.com-Toolkit-for-PHP).

This package is a refactored version of the above package to support PHP version > 5.4. It uses composers default PSR-4 Autoloading. All the class are separated into dedicated files to take advantage of namespaces and autoloading functionality in PHP frameworks. All the test cases are same as in the above package.
